# Custom Classes - Object-Oriented Programming in Java

This repository contains a collection of Java programs designed to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each exercise focuses on creating and testing custom classes to represent real-world objects. The exercises cover basic principles of OOP, including encapsulation, constructors, methods, and object interaction.

## Contents

1. [Rectangle Class](./src/customclasses/rectangle/README.md) - Defines a `Rectangle` class and demonstrates calculating area and perimeter.
2. [StopWatch Class](./stopWatch/README.md) - Implements a `StopWatch` class to measure elapsed time for a sorting task.
3. [Fan Class](./san/README.md) - Models a `Fan` with adjustable speed, color, and operational state.
4. [PC System Simulation](./system/README.md) - Simulates a PC system with a `CPU` and `HardDisk` by using composition.

## Getting Started

To explore each example, navigate to its folder and review the README for implementation details, code snippets, and sample outputs.

## Conclusion

Through these exercises, I have gained hands-on experience with OOP principles in Java, improving my understanding of encapsulation, data fields, constructors, and methods. Combining classes also highlighted the power of composition, allowing the creation of complex objects from simpler ones.
