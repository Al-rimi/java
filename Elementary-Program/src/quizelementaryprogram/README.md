# Quiz Elementary Program - Advanced Exercises

This directory contains Java programs focused on more advanced algorithmic problems, suitable for students who want to deepen their understanding of algorithms and computational problem-solving.

## Programs in this Directory

### 1. **PrimeNumbers.java**

**Imports**: `java.util.Scanner`
- **Purpose**: Finds and displays all prime numbers up to a specified limit (n â‰¤ 1,000,000).
- **Output**: Prints a list of prime numbers, displayed in rows of 10 numbers each.

### 2. **ClosestPair.java**

**Imports**: `java.util.Scanner`, `java.util.Arrays`
- **Purpose**: Finds the two closest points from a set of 2D coordinates using the divide and conquer approach.
- **Output**: Displays the two closest points and the distance between them.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to `Elementary-Program/src/quizelementaryprogram`.
3. Compile and run the Java files with:
   ```
   javac <ProgramName>.java
   java <ProgramName>
   ```

## Conclusion

These programs provide deeper challenges that require a solid understanding of algorithms and computational efficiency. They offer great practice for students preparing for competitive programming or algorithm design courses.
