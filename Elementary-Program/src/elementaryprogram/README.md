# Elementary Program - Core Logic

This directory contains Java source files for fundamental programming exercises, including basic algorithms and problem-solving. Each Java class is designed to implement one specific task from the list of elementary programming exercises.

## Programs in this Directory

### 1. **LeapYear.java**

**Imports**: `java.util.Scanner`
- **Purpose**: Checks if a given year is a leap year based on the rules of the Gregorian calendar.
- **Output**: Prints whether the year is a leap year or not.

### 2. **FutureDay.java**

**Imports**: `java.util.Scanner`
- **Purpose**: Given a starting date, this program calculates and displays the day of the week for a future date.
- **Output**: Prints the day of the week for the future date.

### 3. **CirclePoint.java**

**Imports**: `java.util.Scanner`
- **Purpose**: Determines if a point (x, y) lies inside a circle with a given radius centered at the origin.
- **Output**: Prints whether the point is inside or outside the circle.

### 4. **PalindromeCheck.java**

**Imports**: `java.util.Scanner`
- **Purpose**: Checks if a string is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same backward as forward).
- **Output**: Prints a message indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not.

### 5. **HexToDecimal.java**

**Imports**: `java.util.Scanner`
- **Purpose**: Converts a hexadecimal number (input by the user) into its decimal equivalent.
- **Output**: Prints the decimal value of the hexadecimal input.

### 6. **Pyramid.java**

**Imports**: `java.util.Scanner`
- **Purpose**: Prints a number pyramid based on the user's input for the number of rows.
- **Output**: Displays a pyramid pattern on the console.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to `Elementary-Program/src/elementaryprogram`.
3. Compile and run the Java files with the following commands:
   ```
   javac <ProgramName>.java
   java <ProgramName>
   ```

## Conclusion

These programs are designed to reinforce foundational programming concepts and improve problem-solving skills. You can modify these programs or use them as a base for more advanced exercises.
