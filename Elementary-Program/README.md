# Elementary Programming

This repository contains two core directories: **Elementary Program - Core Logic** and **Quiz Elementary Program - Advanced Exercises**. Together, these directories showcase a progression from foundational programming concepts to more complex problem-solving exercises. Ideal for beginner and intermediate programmers, these Java programs emphasize understanding essential skills, from conditional logic and loops to algorithmic thinking and pattern generation.

## Directory Overview

1. [**Elementary Program - Core Logic**:](./src/elementaryprogram)
   This section covers fundamental programs like leap year checks, date calculations, and basic string manipulations. Designed for newcomers, these exercises introduce Java basics such as control statements and simple input/output handling.

   #### Program List
   - **LeapYear.java**: Determines if a given year is a leap year.
   - **FutureDay.java**: Calculates the day of the week for a future date based on todayâ€™s date.
   - **CirclePoint.java**: Checks if a point `(x, y)` lies within a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin.
   - **PalindromeCheck.java**: Determines if a given string is a palindrome.
   - **HexToDecimal.java**: Converts a hexadecimal number into its decimal equivalent.
   - **Pyramid.java**: Prints a centered number pyramid based on a specified number of rows.

2. [**Quiz Elementary Program - Advanced Exercises**:](./src/quizelementaryprogram)
   Building on core skills, this directory includes programs with a focus on algorithmic challenges. The tasks require more in-depth problem-solving, exploring concepts such as sorting, searching, and recursive logic.

   #### Program List
   - **PrimeNumbers.java**: Finds and displays all prime numbers up to a specified limit.
   - **ClosestPair.java**: Identifies the two closest points from a set of 2D coordinates.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the desired directory.
3. Compile and run any Java file using:
   ```bash
   javac <ProgramName>.java
   java <ProgramName>
   ```
Each program will prompt you for inputs (as necessary) and display the corresponding outputs on the console.
