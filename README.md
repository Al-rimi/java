# Java Class Projects at ZJNU

Welcome to the repository containing the projects from my Object-Oriented Java class at Zhejiang Normal University (ZJNU). This collection includes a variety of Java programs that demonstrate fundamental and advanced concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). The projects were developed as part of the coursework for the university's Java class. While the ideas and inspirations are drawn from the course, all the code within this repository is my own.

Feel free to explore, use, or modify the code, as this repository is completely open source under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
