# OOP Java Projects â€” Inspired by ZJNU

Welcome to my repository of Java projects developed during the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course at *Zhejiang Normal University (ZJNU)*. This collection showcases key concepts in OOP such as encapsulation, inheritance, and advanced Java features. Each project was designed as part of the course curriculum, but the implementation and code are entirely my own.
